            <p>It took me some time to start photographing the daily ikebana installation at Hikone Station on my way to work. The sign for the electronics shop in the background was an easy device to try to keep things consistent, although I’m not trying to be too scientific.</p>

<p>Eventually, I came to photograph it in the morning when I arrived, and in the evening on my way home.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until much later, when I went back and looked at the photographs, that I saw how much this plant had moved.</p>

            <p>Via Ahmed, p 12. Link to ‘positionality,’ perhaps?</p>

<p>Space acquires ‘‘direction’’ through how bodies inhabit it, just as bodies acquire direction in this inhabitance. Adding ‘‘orientation’’ to the picture gives a new dimension to the critique of the distinction between absolute space and relative space, also described as the distinction between location and position. As Neil Smith and Cindi Katz state: ‘‘In geographical terms, ‘location’ fixes a point in space, usually by reference to some abstract co-ordinate systems such as latitude and longitude,’’ while ‘‘ ‘Position,’ by contrast, implies location vis- à-vis other locations and incorporates a sense of perspective on other places’’ (1993: 69; see also Cresswell 1996: 156).</p>

So, there is a relation between glass and media theory…</p>

<p>SXXXXXXX was talking about something in relation to the perpendicularity of things, that Shiki was laid out horizontally in bed, but the plants were vertical, something like that. I kind of forget, but it was interesting.</p>

            <p>Note 73
<em>The note that begins the book</em></p>

<p>Following the publication of <em>In the Wake</em>, many people asked me about the process of writing an academic book that speaks to and beyond the academy. More specifically, people wanted to know about the form, and also about the first chapter, “The Wake,” which begins in the register of the autobiographical with my recounting the deaths, in close succession, of three members of my immediate family between May 2013 and February 2014. It was an ethical decision to include them because while I was reading and writing and thinking about Black people being murdered and about what we make in the face of all that structural violence, I was in the midst of so much personal loss. I thought that this loss also needed to be on the page explicity, not just implicitly in the ways that, whether one admits it or not, one is oriented to one’s work from the location of the body and all that that may mean.</p>

<p>It is the note that begins that book.</p>

            <p>I really like the way he deals with the critique of Rirkrit Tiravanija’s work in terms of being “Thai,” when in his case that category is barely meaningful. Teh is dealing very handily with the pressures of the contemporary art market and museum structure for artists to be easily identifiable by nationality, especially when they come from South or Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>“Can this artist—born in Buenos Aires, trained in Toronto and Chicago, transposing his New York apartment into a Gennan institution—really be communicating there only as a Thai? Does an artist’s every move carry an overriding ethical obligation to speak from or to their national polity of origin?” 8</p>

<p>“But as we will see Thainess—as much as any national identifier, and probably more than most—is less a biological fact than a performance, a slow and convoluted becoming.” 9</p>

It is therefore always a provisional genealogy of the relation between “art” and “society,” that is, the irreducible dialectic of the art form (and the immanent relations that constitute it as an object) and the social form (and the immanent relations of conflict that animate it). I take “art history” to be an endless critical revision of successive presents of past constitutions of the “art and society” relation.”</p>

            <p>We’re not dealing, needless to say, with a recipe or prescription. (“Painter, be as narrow-minded as Matisse …”) We’re confronting one of the paradoxes of modernity: that those who are surest they can speak to modern life almost invariably reproduce nothing but clichés about it; and that a few—a very few—of those holding modernity (rightfully) in contempt, but (wrongfully) thinking art might offer a way out of it, end up, poor devils, with the feel of the modern issuing from their brush.</p>

            <p>In speaking to Okinawans, for instance, you would probably have to begin by marking your position as a member of Japan proper. But, as soon as you do so, you would probably have to consider another question. Is this distinction between Okinawa and Japan proper itself, not discriminatory? But, then, is it justifiable to include the Okinawans and yourself under the general category of the Japanese? I am sure more questions would arise. So, this initial marking does not confine a person to that position at all. Rather it is a step to be taken in order to realize that the position you hold is internally fragmented, far from being a stable closure, and in fact is open to multiple commitments and multiple contexts. It is necessary to mark your position in order for you not to be contained by it.</p>

What holds that category together?</strong> Might the Chinese photographers in Mozambique have more in common with Indonesian Chinese photographers than with Nigerians embellishing their clothes digitally? Might these latter individuals have more in common with Australian Aboriginal communities using cell phones to make ancestral connections than with colonial photographers in South Africa? What is the basis of the categories by which we divide up our scholarship and put practices into relation, and how does photography as a mobile and global technology challenge these boundary-making practices? <strong>I’m not suggesting Africa doesn’t matter as place and idea in these photographies, but when and how does it matter, and when are other connections salient?</strong></p>
