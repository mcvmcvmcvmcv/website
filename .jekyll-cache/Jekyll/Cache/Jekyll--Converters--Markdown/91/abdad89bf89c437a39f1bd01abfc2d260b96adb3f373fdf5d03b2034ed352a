I"<p>This is from SXXXXXXX-san, talking to him in Beppu. In his later years, Shiki was bedridden with TB, and when the technology of glass changed so that it was more flat, he was able to see the plants outside of his window more clearly. So, there is a relation between glass and media theoryâ€¦</p>

<p>SXXXXXXX was talking about something in relation to the perpendicularity of things, that Shiki was laid out horizontally in bed, but the plants were vertical, something like that. I kind of forget, but it was interesting.</p>
