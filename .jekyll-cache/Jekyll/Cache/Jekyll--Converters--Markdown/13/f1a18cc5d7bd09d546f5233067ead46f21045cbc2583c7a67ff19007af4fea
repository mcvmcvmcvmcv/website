I"9<p>Just wanting to remember his name. Saw a couple of books of his at Librarie Astarte yesterday, the Zokushin essay was reproduced in one of them, a volume from 1977. He is someone else I could think about for this time… who was he? What was his overall line?</p>

<p>He is writing about furusato / 故郷</p>
