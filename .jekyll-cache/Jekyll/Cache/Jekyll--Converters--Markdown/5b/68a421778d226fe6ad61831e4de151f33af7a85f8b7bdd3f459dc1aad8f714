I"y<p>In speaking to Okinawans, for instance, you would probably have to begin by marking your position as a member of Japan proper. But, as soon as you do so, you would probably have to consider another question. Is this distinction between Okinawa and Japan proper itself, not discriminatory? But, then, is it justifiable to include the Okinawans and yourself under the general category of the Japanese? I am sure more questions would arise. So, this initial marking does not confine a person to that position at all. Rather it is a step to be taken in order to realize that the position you hold is internally fragmented, far from being a stable closure, and in fact is open to multiple commitments and multiple contexts. It is necessary to mark your position in order for you not to be contained by it.</p>
