I"(<p>YXXX was telling me about him. Some relation to Arakawa Shusaku, possibly a relation to Lee Ufan? His <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B8%82%E5%B7%9D%E6%B5%A9">wikipedia page</a> says he was related to Taki Koji. Writing his first book in 1975â€¦ worth following up on, I think.</p>
