<strong>Organizer</strong>: Daniel Abbe <br />
<strong>Date:</strong> March 7 [proposed]<br />
<strong>Time:</strong> 4-6pm [proposed]</p>

<p>====</p>

<p>A one time seminar in which we will discuss the mutually connected concepts of orientation, space and body, as they relate to the production and experience of art. Attention will be paid to how Ahmed’s discussion of queerness might inform or challenge these concepts. We will work through the texts and the ideas presented there together. There are no right answers here.</p>
