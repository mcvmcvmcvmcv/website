I"ø<p>It took me some time to start photographing the daily ikebana installation at Hikone Station on my way to work. The sign for the electronics shop in the background was an easy device to try to keep things consistent, although Iâ€™m not trying to be too scientific.</p>

<p>Eventually, I came to photograph it in the morning when I arrived, and in the evening on my way home.</p>

<p>It wasnâ€™t until much later, when I went back and looked at the photographs, that I saw how much this plant had moved.</p>
