**Title:** Body, Space, Queer<br>
**Organizer**: Daniel Abbe <br>
**Date:** March 7 [proposed]<br>
**Time:** 4-6pm [proposed]

====

A one time seminar in which we will discuss the mutually connected concepts of orientation, space and body, as they relate to the production and experience of art. Attention will be paid to how Ahmed's discussion of queerness might inform or challenge these concepts. We will work through the texts and the ideas presented there together. There are no right answers here. 

**Readings:**

<a href="/files/2006 - Ahmed - Queer phenomenology.pdf">Sara Ahmed, Queer Phenomenology, 2006</a> (pages 65-79 only)<br>
<a href="/files/2020 - Kriebel - Florence Henri's Oblique.pdf">Sabine Kriebel, "Florence Henri's Oblique," 2020</a>

**Requirements:**
- Carefully read both texts
- Prepare one question about any part of the reading; you will be asked to write this on the board
    - Note: there is no such thing as a question that is too simple. If you are wondering about how to prepare a "good" question, <a href="https://avidly.lareviewofbooks.org/2016/09/13/we-arent-here-to-learn-what-we-know-we-already-know/">I highly recommend this article</a>

Capacity: 10 people, please email ahead of time to confirm (<a href="mailto:abbe@ucla.edu">abbe@ucla.edu</a>)
