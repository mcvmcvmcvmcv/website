title: Aveek Sen
---

<p>With sadness, I would like to mark the passing of Aveek Sen, a writer who leaves behind a body of work that may be scattered in its places of publication (newspaper columns for the The Telegraph, catalog essays, assorted blog posts) but not at all in its style, clarity and verve. I am leaving a few links here to some of Aveek&#8217;s writing, and will update the post over time. </p>
