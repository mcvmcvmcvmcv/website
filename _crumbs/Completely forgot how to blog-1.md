Of course that is the point of not keeping the dates here. Even scrolling back for one minute in my old posts makes me realize that I was thinking of doing something a little more free. It's a habit to be cultivated, to keep the fingers moving across the keys, as I always tell myself. Maybe I should post some more photos, like of the ikebana at Hikone, etc. The container is here, in any case. Posting this as a reminder.
