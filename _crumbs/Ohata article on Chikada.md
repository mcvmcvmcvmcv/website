Ohata wrote [this article](x-devonthink-item://FE48BABE-FE08-4BCD-858C-26D0C19674F8) about Chikada Yoichi 近田洋一, the journalist who I know from his articles about the Matsunaga Yu incident. CHikada was invited to Chikuho 筑豊 in 1969 October because of the 「おきなわを考える会」.

Chikada later moved to Saitama, and worked with a group of disability activists protesting for better access to train stations. He wrote a book based on a series of columns he wrote on this in 1985.

Chikada finds a very interesting similariry of relation between able-bodied / disabled people and mainland / Okinawa. He overlaps the two (this is from his text called 私がみた本土のなかの＜沖縄＞):

> そこから周囲を見渡すと、＜沖縄>はいたるところにあった。学校に、崩壊していく農村に、管理社会のなかに。つまり、本土のなかにさまざまなかたちである非人間性の総体が＜沖縄＞だった。
