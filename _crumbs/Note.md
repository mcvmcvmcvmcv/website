I spent probably far too long moving this blog over to GitHub, so now I can update it smoothly, straight from Terminal actually. I finished that work over a month ago, after tearing my hair out trying to figure out how to get images to work properly, and then of course I haven't written anything since, even though that would not be at all obvious because for the moment I am not displaying any dates on these posts. I like the idea that they do not need to add up to some sort of "consistent" flow of contentâ€”these little notes are meant to be "crumbs" I am leaving for myself so that I can be reminded, later on, of things that came to me while reading or taking notes on the fly, often on my phone, which I'm happy to post more or less as-is. 

Perhaps I am even "breaking" the consistency of the blog by writing down this meta-reflection on its content, when I have intended it mostly as a personal resource that I just sort of happen to make public. Lately, I realize that I do miss blogging as a form, or maybe as a practice, something about it feels very natural to me, it reinforces certain good habits and tendencies, and I like the idea of doing something in a very small corner of the internet, with no comments, no stat counters, in a very rough way, where I can string together as many clauses as I like without worrying about the repercussions. So, no dates for now, but I'll probably add permalinks, and eventually I will have to start splitting the page up when there's too much content here. 

These reflections are heavily inspired by [recent](https://cdxs.ist/posts/2025-02-21-18-17/) [posts](https://cdxs.ist/posts/2025-03-01-20-02/) that my sister Becca has made on her own new blog.
