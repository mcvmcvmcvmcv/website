Via Ahmed, p 12. Link to 'positionality,' perhaps?

Space acquires ‘‘direction’’ through how bodies inhabit it, just as bodies acquire direction in this inhabitance. Adding ‘‘orientation’’ to the picture gives a new dimension to the critique of the distinction between absolute space and relative space, also described as the distinction between location and position. As Neil Smith and Cindi Katz state\: ‘‘In geographical terms, ‘location’ fixes a point in space, usually by reference to some abstract co-ordinate systems such as latitude and longitude,’’ while ‘‘ ‘Position,’ by contrast, implies location vis- à-vis other locations and incorporates a sense of perspective on other places’’ \(1993\: 69; see also Cresswell 1996\: 156\).
