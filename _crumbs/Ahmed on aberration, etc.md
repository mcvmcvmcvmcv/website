Ahmed talks about the work of Sexologist Havelock Ellis, which I think has some nice resonances with Domon’s ideas of “aberration” and so on: “An aberration can refer to ‘‘the act of wandering from the usual way or normal course,’’ or even to a ‘‘deviation from truth or moral rectitude.’’ The same-sex orientation thus deviates or is off course.”
