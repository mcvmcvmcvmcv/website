Gabriel Orozco question: he wants to know how artists on tje left were split, who went for military and imperial art, was there something like degenerate art, etc. This os a story that we do not know in English. And we do know the story in German say. I started to talk about tenko, Jelena’s book etc. Maybe there is something done in intellectual history or literature but not so much art?
