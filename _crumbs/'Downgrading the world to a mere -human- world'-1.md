Karl Löwith's ideas sound so much like Nakahira's. Check out these quotes (glosses in an article by Flavia Baldari): 

> In his discussion of the idea of progress, Löwith focuses his criticism on the modern scientific spirit and the anthropocentric standpoint that consid- ers the world an object for humans to manipulate for their own profit. 118

> Löwith affirms that our way of being in the world is, in reality, just one more aspect of the world-human relationship. Modern science with its thirst for invention, progress, and advancement concentrates its efforts only on the practical utility of nature, downgrading the world to a mere *human* world. 120
