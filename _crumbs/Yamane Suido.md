One of the first people to consider ikebana and photography together, I think. 

<img src="{{ page.image_path | resize: page.image_resize }}" alt="An ikebana arrangement from 1927 by Yamane Suido" />

This image is a scan of a printout of a scan (from the [NDL](https://ndlsearch.ndl.go.jp/books/R100000002-I000000755951)) of a 1927 book caled 新時代の插花, or *The New Age of Flower Arrangement*. The word Yamane uses for "flower arrangement," 插花/sōka, is closer to a Chinese term, the dictionary says it is "literary." 

I guess [*Some Japanese Flowers*](https://archive.org/details/sr-189/page/n57/mode/2up) by Ogawa Kazumasa is an even earlier precursor, although it is less obviously about ikebana.
