"I suppose a lot of my work in the last ten years has been exactly about how to theorize and conceptualize identity and identification which holds these two things together. I mean, the closest that I can come to it is to say that, of course, <span class="highlight">all enunciation is positioned. Without positioning, there is no meaning. You have to take up a position.</span> If we believe in the infinite semiosis of meaning, no position is final. It's a question of how to think the need for a positionality that is not final, <span class="highlight">what a not fully closed position is.</span>"

From the Trajectories book p 373
